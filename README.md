My name is Layne Liu. I'm studying for a master's degree in computing science at Utrecht University. Before this, I received my bachelor's degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and worked as a cloud computing engineer at China Pacific Insurance Company for almost two years.

🔭 I’m currently working on type analysis for Python. Type analysis is a type of static analysis. To be honest, it's not trivial to do Python type inference.

I prefer three programming languages -- C++, Python and Haskell. C++ forces me to think what really programming languages are. Python is concise and easy to express my ideas clearly. As for Haskell, I don't like it at the very beginning. But it's pretty close to math, which makes it elegant. Anyway, it's a super niche language.
