## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
My name is Layne Liu. From January 2023 onwards, I will be a PHD candidate in the TU Delft Programming Languages Group at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). Before this, I received my master's degree in computing science at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) and my bachelor's degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). Before my master's study, I worked as a cloud engineer at [China Pacific Insurance Company](https://www.cpic.com.cn/) for almost two years.

### My favorite programming languages
I prefer three languages ---- C++, Python and Haskell.
- C++ forces me to think deeply about a problem.
- Python is concise and easy to express my ideas clearly.
- Haskell, which is a pure functional language, gives me lots of new experiences.
