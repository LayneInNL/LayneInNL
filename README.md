## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

### About me
My name is Layne Liu (my real first name is Xulei, never mind). I am a PhD student under [Casper Bach Poulsen](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/c.b.poulsen/?cHash=2da108945c5287a90cdaacb197983bfa)'s supervision in the [TU Delft Programming Languages Group](https://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/) at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (TUD). Before this, I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) (UU) and my bachelor's degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). 

Before my master's study, I worked as a cloud engineer at [China Pacific Insurance Company](https://www.cpic.com.cn/) (CPIC) for almost two years. I really appreciated the work-life balance offered by CPIC. I had no chance to obtain my admission letter from UU without it, let alone my PhD position from TUD.
