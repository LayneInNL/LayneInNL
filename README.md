## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
My name is Layne Liu. I am a PhD student in the [TU Delft Programming Languages Group](http://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/) at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (TUD). Before this, I obtained my master's degree in Computing Science at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) (UU) and my bachelor's degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). 

Before my master's study, I worked as a cloud engineer at [China Pacific Insurance Company](https://www.cpic.com.cn/) (CPIC) for almost two years. I really appreciated the work-life balance offered by CPIC. I had no chance to obtain my admission letter from UU without it, let alone my PhD position from TUD.
